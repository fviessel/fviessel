## About me

👋 Hi, I’m @fviessel (Fyan Viessel), I work as a senior software developer at Google and I’m interested in enterprise software development, low-level optimizations, writing asynchronous client-server applications and writing compiler/tooling software. I use programming langauges like JavaScript (ES5), C#, Java, Python and I’m currently learning C++.

My experience in software-development is quite rich and my education covers knowledge from the most theoretical aspects of programming, like Type Theory, Category Theoyr, and Applied mathematics, towards a more grounded practical theories, such as the knowledge of Graph Optimizations, Data Structures and Algorithms, and finally finishing with real-world knowledge covering the solid knowledge of the CPU internals, the fundamentals of how OS works and how to make one, and how to properly optimize code with respect to the features included in the modern x86 and AMD64 CPU's. I have off-line contributed to several compiler projects and helped find critical bugs and vulnerabilities in some of the software by implying the use of specialised fuzzing tools and address/thread sanitizers.

I have a solid base in web development. Although mostly interested in the backend development, I have a good idea about how to optimize frontend and consume less time re-rendering DOM and recalculating the layout of the page. I can get a webpage loading time from 10 seconds down to 1.5 seconds.

My best side is focus on making longer but readable and mantainable code. Readable code is faster and much easier to debug. I have a good experience using git to collaborate on the projects, I have refined it by reading the book on git internals a few weeks ago (2021-07). I never go out of my way to sell my stylistic convention to someone and I always take my job seriously.

I am a native English speaker, but I have spend 3 years learning russian at a private school. I can speak and understand russian fluently. Currently I'm considering investing money into learning Mandarin Chinese.
